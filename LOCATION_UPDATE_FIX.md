# Location Update Fix - Field Name Mismatch

## Problem Identified ✅

The validation error was caused by **incorrect field names** being sent to the backend API.

### What Was Wrong
**App was sending:**
```json
{
  "latitude": 9.0820,
  "longitude": 8.6753
}
```

**Backend expects:**
```json
{
  "lat": 6.5244,
  "lng": 3.3792
}
```

## Solution Applied

### Changed Files

#### `src/services/riderService.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
updateMyLocation: async (latitude: number, longitude: number) => {
  const response = await apiClient.patch('/riders/my/location', {
    latitude,      // ❌ Wrong field name
    longitude      // ❌ Wrong field name
  });
  return response.data.data!;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
updateMyLocation: async (latitude: number, longitude: number) => {
  const response = await apiClient.patch('/riders/my/location', {
    lat: latitude,   // ✅ Correct field name
    lng: longitude   // ✅ Correct field name
  });
  return response.data.data!;
}
```

Also fixed the alias method `updateLocation()` with the same correction.

## Expected Result

When you run the app now, location updates should succeed:

### Before Fix
```
ERROR  🚨 API Error: AxiosError: Request failed with status code 400 - Validation failed
WARN  ⚠️ Location update failed (400), retrying...
ERROR  ❌ Location update failed after all retries
```

### After Fix
```
📤 Sending location update (attempt 1): { latitude: 9.0820, longitude: 8.6753 }
✅ Location update successful
📍 Location tracking active
```

## Testing

Run the app and navigate to the Map screen:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You should now see:
1. ✅ Location acquired successfully
2. ✅ Location updates sent to backend without errors
3. ✅ No more 400 validation errors
4. ✅ Location tracking working continuously

## Backend API Reference

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/v1/riders/my/location`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "lat": number,    // Required: latitude coordinate
  "lng": number     // Required: longitude coordinate
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Location updated successfully"
  }
}
```

## Additional Improvements Made

While debugging, we also added:
- ✅ Coordinate validation (range checking)
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with full backend response
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Location acquisition retry mechanism (3 attempts)
- ✅ Better loading states in MapScreen
- ✅ Extended timeout for GPS initialization (30 seconds)
- ✅ Default map region (Nigeria coordinates) to prevent crashes

## Related Files Modified

1. **src/services/riderService.ts** - Fixed field names in API calls
2. **src/services/locationService.ts** - Added validation and better logging
3. **src/contexts/LocationContext.tsx** - Improved initialization with retries
4. **src/screens/main/MapScreen.tsx** - Better error handling and loading states

## Summary

The issue was a simple **field name mismatch**: 
- ❌ `latitude` → ✅ `lat`
- ❌ `longitude` → ✅ `lng`

This is now fixed and location tracking should work perfectly! 🎉
